# Neural Networksâ€”An Overview

The term _neural network_ is an evocative one, suggesting machines capable of
human-level intelligence, autonomy, and even consciousness.

While modern artificial neural networks were inspired by mammalian biological
neural networks, it is clear that the architecture of biological networks is so
much more complex, and the networks so much more capable
