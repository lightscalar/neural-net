There is an advantage to implementing neural networks from scratchâ€”in Python, 
for example. This can be very instructive. But from a practical perspective, 
rolling your own Python code will not cut it for real world applications. In
order to get realistic networks for function on real data, we need to   

## Deep Learning & Hierarchical Representations

Nature is hierarchical.

## The Importance of Hierarchy

## How is this possible?

In the last decade, computational power has become absurdly cheap.


One of the most critical pieces of technology to emerge is the Graphical
Processing Unit (GPU).

While modern artificial neural networks (ANNs) were originally inspired by
biological neural networks, it is now clear that the architecture of the
biological networks are so much more complex, and the networks so much more
capable, that it is better not to draw too many parallels between biological
networks and their artificial counterparts.

The reasons for this ascent are two-fold. Deep neural networks are very
computationally expensive. The cost of computational power has fallen
dramatically over the last sixty years. Consider Figure 1.1, which plots the
cost of one billion floating point operations per second from 1960 until
January 2015.

![The cost of one billion floating point operations per second (one GFLOPS) in
adjusted 2013 dollars, from 1960 to 2015. In that 55 year span, the cost of a
GFLOPS has dropped an astonishing amount, from $8.3 trillion to $0.08. Note the
scale here is logarithmic.
