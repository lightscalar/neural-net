# Neurons — The Fundamental Building Blocks

The human brain consists of approximately $$10^{11}$$ individual neurons.

```python
def brain(args):
    # Now we need to do things with the "arguments". 
    return  args + 1   
```

Let's write down an import equation, like Eq. \ref{matrix}:

$$
A_{ij} = 42 \tag{1} \label{matrix}
$$

But perhaps you are inspired by poetry? Here is a quote:

> There is a pleasure in the pathless woods,   
> There is a rapture on the lonely shore,  
> There is society, where none intrudes,  
> By the deep Sea, and music in its roar:  
> I love not Man the less, but Nature more,  
> From these our interviews, in which I steal  
> From all I may be, or have been before,  
> To mingle with the Universe, and feel  
> What I can ne’er express, yet cannot all conceal.

 This is a lengthier caption, one that we might have if we needed to explain
an important concept, particularly one that is compelex.
