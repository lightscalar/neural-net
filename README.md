# Introduction

The term _neural network_ is an evocative one, suggesting machines capable of
human-level intelligence, autonomy, and even sentience. More than any other
technology in the now maturing discipline of [machine
learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning), neural networks are
redolent of science fiction, bringing to mind the misanthropic intellect of
[HAL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_9000) 9000 in _2001: A Space Odyssey_,
or the genial wisdom of Lieutenant Commander
[Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(Star_Trek), from _Star Trek_.

While modern artificial neural networks (ANNs) were originally inspired by
biological neural networks, it is now clear that the architecture of biological
networks are so much more complex, and the networks so much more capable, that
it is better not to draw too many parallels between the biological networks and
their artificial counterparts.

### How is this possible?

In the last decade computational power has become cheaper

![The cost of one billion floating point operations per second (one GFLOPS) in
2013 dollars, from 1960 to 2015. In that 55 year span, the price of a GFLOPS
has dropped an astonishing amount, from $8.3 trillion to $0.08.

#### The Rise of the GPU

One of the most critical pieces of technology to emerge is the Graphical
Processing Unit (GPU).
