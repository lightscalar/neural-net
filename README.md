The term _neural network_ is an evocative one, suggesting machines capable of
human-level intelligence, autonomy, and even sentience. More than any other
technology in the discipline of [machine
learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning), neural networks are
redolent of science fiction, bringing to mind the malevolent intellect of [HAL
9000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_9000) from _2001: A Space Odyssey_, or
the genial wisdom of [Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(Star_Trek) from
_Star Trek_. Yet neural networks are now ubiquitous, if largely invisible. They
are not sentient AIs, but rather increasingly useful tools for solving
problems that simply cannot be tackled by other methods. Voice recognition,
machine language translation, and image recognition are now possible due to the
rise of practical neural networks. 

The aim of this book is to demystify neural networks and deep learning, and to
introduce the reader to them in a pragmatic way, so that she will not only
understand the underlying mathematics, but will also be able to readily
implement networks to solve real world problems. For this purpose, we use the
powerful [Tensor Flow](http://www.tensorflow.org/) machine intelligence package
recently open-sourced by Google. 

Why TensorFlow? There are many packages out there, including
[Torch7](http://torch.ch), [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/),
and others.
